  "cover_prompt": "A spectral, translucent figure composed of cascading digital data and fragmented memories reaches towards a solid, human hand, their fingertips almost touching across a shimmering barrier of static, within the vast and surreal archive of the Unfinished; towering shelves stretch into infinity, holding not books but glowing cubes containing frozen moments, flickering film reels of last goodbyes, and antique radios whispering lost conversations, all under a ceiling that glitches between a starry night sky and a cracked plaster dome. In the atmospheric style of a digital-native surrealist blending the intricate detail of James Jean with the melancholic glitch aesthetics of Petra Cortright and the architectural solemnity of Giorgio de Chirico, presented as a book cover with a centered, monumental composition viewed from a low, dramatic angle that emphasizes the towering shelves and the vast emotional distance between the two figures. Cinematic volumetric lighting pierces the dusty air, casting long shadows and highlighting the contrast between the warm, analog glow of brass and walnut and the cold, electric blues and data-green pulses of the digital ghost, all washed in a palette of archival sepia, cathode-ray tube blue, and fleeting rose-gold. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
