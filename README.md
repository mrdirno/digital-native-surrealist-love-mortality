## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character documents a seemingly mundane 'interrupted journey' (e.g., a melted ice sculpture, a book left on a bus) and discovers its profound connection to a stranger's life.
- Create a monologue from a 'digital ghost'—someone who feels they exist only as data and notifications—encountering a raw, physical emotion for the first time.
- Imagine a 'memory palace' not for memories, but for futures that never happened. Describe one wing of this palace and its curator.
- Write the dialogue for a final conversation between two lovers where one is trying to 'optimize' their goodbye, and the other is trying to 'glitch' it into something unforgettable.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a simple web-based 'Catalogue of Unfinished Journeys' where users can submit a photo and short text about an interrupted moment. Use a minimalist, archival aesthetic.
- Create a generative art piece that visualizes 'data ghosts' or 'residual data glow' described in the novel, using p5.js or similar to represent digital traces in an analog space.
